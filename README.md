# RSV-Project-1      DAILY RSV MOTIVATION

## Our inspiration, is to bring users daily motivational quotes, energising each visitor with positivity to either feul the day ahead or reset their day.  We want to be the leading motivational app encouraging users on their unique journey of wellbeing - albeit with a little sass that everyone needs.  To further feed inquistive minds, we have added a Wikipedia API to give the user an opportunity to delve into their much loved quote or personality. 

## This application gives the user a random quote to help set the tone of their mood - the on click button gives the user the control to then move forward to another quote if desired. Searched items in Wikipedia are then saved in local storage holding informatin which will be used in later development, personalising each visit.

## We love the apps ability to give the user the functionality of being selected at random, elevating the vistors experience via engagement.  This function will then be evolved with online excerise apps.
